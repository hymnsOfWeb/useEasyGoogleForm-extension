5. Click on `Load Unpacked` button and select the unzipped folder.

That's it. Now you can use the extension.

### Usage :

1. Open the google form you want to use in your react project.
2. After making all the changes in the form, just refresh / reload your page.

You should see a new react component created for your google form. You can copy the component and use it in your react project.
